\caption{\textbf{Daily EPA reference monitor PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations versus smoke plumes overhead}. Models with any plumes and models with plumes disaggregated by density both include EPA monitor by month fixed effects and day-of-sample fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the county level, and p-values on two-sided t-test are shown in brackets.}
