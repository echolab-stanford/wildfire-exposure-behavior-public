\caption{\textbf{Smoke exposure does not robustly increase search activity for non-smoke related search terms, and non-smoke \pmt exposure does not increase smoke-related search activity}. We test whether the estimated relationship between smoke exposure and smoke-related search activity could be spurious by estimating the effect of smoke exposure on search terms plausibly unrelated to smoke, choosing search terms related to other environmental disasters ("floods", "hurricanes"), to other phenomena with regional or seasonal search patterns ("steph curry", "USWNT"), or to something entirely unrelated ("dinosaurs").  Each column is a separate regression, with the search term listed at the top of the column, and with two different sets of fixed effects run for each search term as indicated at bottom. Estimated effect sizes are close to zero, only one out of 10 estimates is significant at conventional confidence intervals, and that estimate loses significance under alternate fixed effects. Last column shows the effect of variation in non-smoke \pmt on smokeless days on smoke-related search activity, again finding very small effects not statistically different than zero. Standard errors are shown in parenthesis, clustered at the county-month, and p-values on two-sided t-test are shown in brackets.}
