\caption{\textbf{Sentiment results are robust to alternate samples, FE, and controls}. Each column is a separate linear regression of sentiment on smoke \pmt. Column 1 is baseline specification, column 2 includes controls for daily temperature and precipitation,  columns 3-4 restrict panel to county-days $<$ or $>$ 50km from an active wildfire fire, columns 5-6 uses more restrictive time FE; m.o.s = month of sample, m.o.y = month of year. Smoke \pmt is measured in $\mu$g/m$^3$, with coefficients multiplied by 1000 to make them legible. Dependent variable is average sentiment on a county-day. Included fixed effects in each regression are shown at bottom. Standard errors are shown in parenthesis, clustered at the county-month, and p-values on two-sided t-test are shown in brackets.}
