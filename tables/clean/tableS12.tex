\caption{\textbf{Hourly EPA reference monitor PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations versus different constructions of Purple Air PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations}. Each column is a separate linear regression with hourly PM$_{2.5}$ concentration at an EPA reference monitor as the dependent variable and a different version of Purple Air derived PM$_{2.5}$ concentration as the independent variable. All models include EPA monitor fixed effects, hour-of-day fixed effects, and month-of-sample fixed effects. Standard errors are shown in parentheses, and p-values on two-sided t-test are shown in brackets.}
